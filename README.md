# Time Series Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing time series analysis on monthly temperature and salinity data for a 4°x4° region in the Bay of Bengal from 1871 to 2010.

## Project Overview

- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed monthly temperature and salinity data to understand climatological patterns using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identified trends and patterns in the data to detect regions of positive and negative phases of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), El-Nino, and La-Nina years.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implemented machine learning models including RandomForest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree to predict Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) for the next five years up to 2015.



## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
